## 🎯 Key Features (Planned)

### Core Functionality
- **Telnet Communication**: Direct connection to Wattbox 800 series
- **Outlet Control**: Individual and master outlet control
- **Power Monitoring**: Voltage, current, and power consumption
- **Status Monitoring**: Device connectivity and error detection
- **Auto Reboot Control**: Enable/disable auto-reboot functionality

### Technical Features
- **HACS Compatible**: Easy installation through HACS
- **Async Support**: Full async/await implementation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Configurable Polling**: Adjustable update intervals
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout

## 📊 GitHub Issues Created

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. **[#1] Project Setup and Repository Structure** - Infrastructure setup
2. **[#2] Basic Telnet Client Implementation** - Core communication
3. **[#3] HACS Integration Structure** - Home Assistant integration
4. **[#4] Outlet Control Implementation** - Switch entities
5. **[#5] Power Monitoring Sensors** - Sensor entities
6. **[#6] Unit Tests** - Testing framework
7. **[#7] Integration Tests** - Real device testing
8. **[#9] HACS Submission** - Community distribution

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
9. **[#8] Status Monitoring** - Binary sensor entities

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with Issue #1**: Complete project setup and repository structure
2. **Begin Issue #2**: Implement basic telnet client
3. **Test with Real Device**: Validate telnet commands with your Wattbox 800

### Development Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Core telnet client and basic outlet control
2. **Phase 2**: Power monitoring and status sensors
3. **Phase 3**: Testing and documentation
4. **Phase 4**: HACS submission and community support

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Based on Research
- **Telnet Protocol**: Using patterns from companion module
- **Command Structure**: `!OutletSet=<outlet>,<command>` for control
- **Query Commands**: `?Voltage`, `?Current`, `?Power` for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Robust connection management and recovery
- **Home Assistant**: Full integration with proper entity structure

### Key Insights
- **800 Series Specific**: Requires telnet, not HTTP like older models
- **Custom Implementation**: No existing Python library supports telnet
- **Companion Module**: Excellent reference for command patterns
- **HACS Ready**: Following all HACS guidelines and requirements

## 📈 Success Metrics
